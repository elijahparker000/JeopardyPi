The current GUI:

## Create .env file
Create a new file in the main JeopardyPi directory named .env and add the following line to it
```
PROJ_PATH = "<path to the JeopardyPi directory on your machine>"
```
Also, install this library:
```
pip install python-dotenv
```

Now whenever you need a path, just do it like this:
```
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from the .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access the PROJ_PATH environment variable
proj_path = os.getenv('PROJ_PATH')


# Specify the path to your file
file_path = os.path.join(proj_path, "clues/jeopardy.csv")
```

Note: The .env file is listed in .gitignore, so it won't be tracked by git and thus won't mess up everyone else's .env files.

## How to run flask GUI with electron
### Install flask
```
pip install flask
```
To test it, you can navigate to the flask_test directory and run app.py and the terminal should provide you with a link you can open in your browser to see the GUI. Next, we want to run that GUI in a window rather than a browser.

### Install Node.js
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Next, navigate to the jeopardy-electron directory and run these three commands:
```
npm init -y
```
```
npm install electron
```
```
npm start
```
You should see the same GUI as before but this time in a window! 
If you run into any issues just copy and paste these instructions into ChatGPT and tell it where you're having trouble.
